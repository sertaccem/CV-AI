# Computer Vision and Artificial Intelligence First Assignment Python Codes - Sertac Cem

Hi,

You will see 2 different python notebook. v4 is the main notebook, v5 contains only distribution of width and heights of images from train dataset. I had to create two different notebook because during doing assignment, I did software upgrade for my Macbook and unfortunately tensorflow library stopped working. Since setting GPU for Macbook with M2 chips is a little bit hard/tricky, I had created a new notebook this is why you will see 2 different notebook. I was able to merge them into one notebook but line numbers would be confusing then so, I preferred to upload 2 different notebook to be more clear and honest.
